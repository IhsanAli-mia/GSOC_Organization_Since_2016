# GSoC Organization Data (2016-2024)

This repository contains sorted data of organizations (in form of a csv file) that participated in Google Summer of Code (GSoC) from 2016 to 2024. The data includes the organization names and the number of projects in each year.

## Data Source

The data in this repository is extracted and organized from [nishantwrp/gsoc-organizations](https://github.com/nishantwrp/gsoc-organizations), which provides comprehensive details about organizations that participated in GSoC over the years.

## Manual

The repository contains a .csv file that has all the output data, along with the source file used to generate it. The JSON data was sourced from the `gsoc-organizations` repository. There might be duplicates in the CSV file due to organization names changing across the years. Manual inspection or further processing might be required to address such inconsistencies.
